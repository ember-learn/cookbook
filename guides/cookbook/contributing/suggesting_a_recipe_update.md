This recipe will walk you throught the best way to suggest an update to an existing recipe.

There is a different recipe for [suggesting a new recipe](./contributing/suggesting_a_recipe).

## The challenge

You noticed that an existing recipe is out of date or does not contain full information, but not sure whats the best way to update an existing recipe. 

## Steps
### Fork the repo 
Fork the [Ember Learn Cookbook repo](https://github.com/ember-learn/cookbook/). 

### Create a feature branch 
A [feature branch](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is a branch in a local git
repository. Its name should be the camel-cased or underscored name of your recipe. For example, the branch
name for updating this recipe "Suggesting a Recipe" would be `UpdateSuggestingARecipe` or `update_suggesting_a_recipe`.

### Update the existing recipe
Make sure that your update follows the [Cookbook template](./contributing/understanding_the_cookbook_format).

### Submitting your recipe
When you are ready to submit your recipe, push your local branch to the remote branch on your GitHub fork and
submit a pull request. 

## Results
