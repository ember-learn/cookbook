Welcome to the Ember.js Cookbook! 

Cookbook-style guides contain recipes that guide a beginning programmer to a deeper knowledge of the subject
by answering specific, "how-to" style questions. Cookbook recipes address more topics than
[API documentation for a class](https://api.emberjs.com/classes/Ember.Application.html), but are smaller in
scope than [a topic-based guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/).

Here are all of the available recipes:
